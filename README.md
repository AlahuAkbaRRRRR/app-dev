# **One Piece**
*The **One Piece** is the name the world gave to all the treasure gained by the Pirate King Gol D. Roger. At least a portion of it once belonged to Joy Boy during the Void Century. The treasure is said to be of unimaginable value, and is currently located on the final island of the Grand Line: Laugh Tale.*

*This anime series has a lot of story to be unfold it can be a sad backstory, about anger and mystery that no one knows what really happened in the **Void Century**. Only a few characters that only knows what really happened on that time even the **Navy Quarters** are having fear of getting the story to be exposed in the Great Pirate Era.

**This series consists a lot of genre every arc**
- Happiness
- Anger
- Revenge
- Fear
- Flashbacks that made the characters unhappy
- And sad stories of every characters that made them stronger up to the latest episode
